Lord BaaBaa has returned and PacWorm’s world is once again in danger! You must destroy Lord BaaBaa’s sheep!

Gameplay:

When the game loads, press ENTER to take control of PacWorm. Use the A and D keys or the arrow keys to steer him to the dancing ghost sheep. Watch out for the trees! You will lose life energy if you run through one. Go after the green cats to get more life energy.
